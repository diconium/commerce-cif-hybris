The CIF Cloud API is the heart of all programmatic interactions with Adobe's commerce integrations. The goal of the CIF Cloud API is to provide a comprehensive and extendable commerce storefront API. The API defines endpoints and data models suitable for all channels of customer facing shopping experiences.

This NPM package contains the Javascript classes of the models defined by the CIF Cloud API.
