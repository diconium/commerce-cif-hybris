## Requirements

All new code should:
* Pass CI checks (tslint, unit tests).
* Include unit tests for any changed code.
* Include relevant updates to `README.md`.
* Be consistent with the existing coding style.

## Issues

It is a good idea (however not strictly required) to create an issue to
discuss changes before making them.

Anyone is welcome to work on any issue marked *help wanted*.
